<h1>Sam Bordiss: <span>Content & User Experience Designer</span></h1>

<h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>

<p class="highlighted-content">
  For over 20 years I have made it my mission to study every aspect of the ever-evolving web industry. This journey has seen me take on the roles of system administrator, front & back-end developer, project manager, user researcher, user experience designer, graphic designer, web designer, content designer, branding designer, and pretty much every other role with the suffix “designer”. 
</p>

<p class="highlighted-content">
  My current focus is promoting the importance of content, accessibility, & user experience design &mdash; three aspects often relegated to afterthoughts at best, rather than integral foundations of any successful digital project.
